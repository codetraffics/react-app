# Master React JS in 7 Hours with 10 Real-World Projects

This project was done with HuXn webdev React JS course [Watch the course of YouTube](https://youtu.be/XrwsMN2IWnE?si=k0Tm7wcT0hol7XOK).

## Roadmap

In this project, I update my progress on mastering React JS on a daily basis:

### `February 3, 2024`

Created independent and reusable functional components using ES7+ React/Redux/React Native snippets extension. And exported the component so that other files can use it.

Wrote JSX code in the components by following the basic rules of JSX: multiple elements should be kept in one parent element, close all tags in JSX, the use of className to provide class to an element, etc.

Used react fragments to display multiple components in App.js

Practiced more on how JSX is compiled into React code using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011%2C%20not%20ie_mob%2011&build=&builtIns=false&corejs=3.21&spec=false&loose=false&code_lz=Q&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&modules=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&timeTravel=false&sourceType=module&lineWrap=true&presets=env%2Creact%2Cstage-2&prettier=false&targets=&version=7.23.10&externalPlugins=&assumptions=%7B%7D).

### `February 5, 2024`

Worked with JavaScript map() method to render links in React.

### `February 6, 2024`

After several hours of watching HuXn WebDev demonstrate props in the video, I mastered props in React and used it to create books component.

### `February 7, 2024`

Implemented conditional rendering with if, && and tenary operator.
Implemented how to add inline styles, separate css file, react bootsrap and tailwind css to a project.
